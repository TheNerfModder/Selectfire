# Selectfire
This is where I keep the info, svgs, and code for for the selectfire modules I am developing
Please contact me at alphamods.commissions@gmail.com with any questions, or leave a comment here.
This will hold everything for the selectfire I have developed, including, but not limited to:
Code
3d models
Wiring Diagrams(which were very professionally done btw) 
and eventually the files for the board itself.


thank you to everyone who helped me learn how to use arduino format, and to those that have been egging me on. Hopefully this helps things out.
